"""Work bound for SPEC.md §11's relocation scan (v1.11).

The shape: N kept ids, each block rewritten in a vocabulary the old text does
not share (so clause 1 holds for every id and the window is always scanned),
and RUN unmarked blocks of the old vocabulary and length typed directly above
each marker (so every window holds RUN free blocks, none scoring 0.8). A
document-wide scan would score every drifted id against all N * RUN free
blocks; the window scores each against its own RUN. The documents come from a
fixed LCG, the same in all four cores' tests, so the shape is identical.

Runnable as ``python test_relocation_cost.py`` or under pytest.
